# Digital Voice Modem FNE Audio Bridge

**THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

The Digital Voice Modem FNE Audio Bridge is a helper application designed to allow Rx and Tx of digital audio from/to PCM.

**NOTE**: This project relies on C++/CLI for interop with the vocoder library, as such it will not function or compile on a Linux/Unix system and requires Windows to function.
